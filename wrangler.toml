# Deploys the static `dist/` folder as a Workers Site. Use `npx wrangler publish`
# or `npx wrangler pages publish dist` depending on whether you want a Worker
# or Pages deployment. If you already have a backend Worker (in `backend/`),
# make sure the backend Worker is NOT routed to `/*` in the Cloudflare dashboard
# otherwise it will intercept root requests.
